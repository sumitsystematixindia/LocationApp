 *  Provide a smiliar functionality than \c cassert, except that
 *  SPATIAL_ENABLE_ASSERT must be defined to enable it, by default, no spatial
 *  assertion check is performed.
 *
 *  This feature is built in the library for the sole purpose of the library
 *  developers, therefore it is encouraged that no one else but the library
 *  developers uses it. It is used during unit testing and debugging.
